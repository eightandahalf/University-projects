The design field is at an inflection paint. It must challenge its repertoire, 
rethink technology, and begin to see biodiversity as a building block of urban 
environments. Julia Watson’s lush and meticulous new book, Lo—TEK: Design by 
Radical Indigenism, provides a blueprint for sustainable architecture in the 
21st century. For designers of the built environment, it is a first-ever compendium 
of overlooked design technologies from indigenous groups around the world. For the 
intrepid traveler or curious citizen, it is an invitation to know millennia-old 
societies thriving in symbiosis with nature thanks to local ingenuity, creativity, 
spirituality, and resourcefulness. For the indigenous groups represented, it is a 
source of satisfaction from seeing contemparary design scholarship catch up with 
their time-tested practices. 

And for Watson, the book is a means to name, document, and create a toolkit for a 
design movement. “Lo-TEK,” is built on “lesser known technologies, traditional 
ecological knowledge (TEK) and indigenous cultural practices and mythologies,” 
as she writes in the book’s introduction. It explores the space where design and 
“radical indigenism” meet. Conceived of by Princeton professor and Cherokee Nation 
member Eva Marie Goutte, radical indigenism encourages us to look to indigenous 
philosophies to rebuild our knowledge base and generate new dialogues across genres. 
Watson is advocating a movement that merges these beliefs with design to yield 
sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructures.
