# String-processing
In this program, I read the original string from a text file, apply the standard encryption algorithm to the resulting string, and write it to the file. 
Task: in the text after the letter P, if it is not the last letter in the word, the letter A is mistakenly printed instead of O. Make corrections to the text.
