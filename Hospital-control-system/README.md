# Hospital-control-system
In this program I create a Patient class, with the following parameters: id, Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, Address, Phone, Medical Record Number, Diagnosis. 
I also create an array of objects and output: 
a) a list of patients who have a certain diagnosis; 
b) a list of patients whose medical record number is in a given interval.
